description: Use any routed model from opencode — opencodex injects a runtime provider block and leaves your own opencode config untouched.
---

opencode reads its providers from merged JSON config layers rather than environment
variables, so there is no `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`-style slot to inject. `ocx opencode`
bridges that gap: it ensures the proxy is running, builds a provider block from the
visible catalog, and injects it through OpenCode's inline runtime layer
(`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`).

## Quickstart

```bash
ocx opencode
```

This ensures the proxy is running and launches opencode with only the generated
`provider.opencodex` block injected for that process. Extra arguments pass through:
`ocx opencode run "hello"`.

Routed models appear in the picker under the `opencodex` provider:

```text
opencodex/kiro/glm-5
opencodex/gpt-5.6-sol      # native slugs stay unprefixed
```

## Your own config is never modified

The launcher does not copy or rewrite `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`,
project `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc`, or any other on-disk config layer. It may
read global or project config to detect a `provider.opencodex` override, while your
existing providers, agents, keybinds, MCP entries, and relative `{file:…}` references
keep resolving from their original files.

For this launch only, opencodex adds the generated `provider.opencodex` block through
OpenCode's inline runtime layer. That layer merges after global/custom/project config
and overrides only conflicting keys for the child process.

| Layer | Behavior with `ocx opencode` |
| --- | --- |
| Global / custom / project config | Left on disk exactly as you wrote it |
| Inline runtime (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`) | Receives only the generated `provider.opencodex` block |
| Relative `{file:…}` paths | Still resolve against the config file that originally defined them |

If a global or project config also defines `provider.opencodex`, the launcher prints an
informational note: the runtime layer from `ocx opencode` overrides it for that launch.

## Putting the block into your own config

`ocx opencode` injects the provider block for one launch only, which means plain `opencode` still
knows nothing about the proxy. When you want routed models available from plain `opencode` — or
from an editor extension that never goes through the launcher — `ocx export` prints the same
provider block for you to merge into your own config:

```bash
ocx export --client opencode
```

The proxy must be running. The command prints the config, the canonical destination
(`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, or under `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when that is set), the merge
warning, and the env export line. It never touches that file — the section above stays true, and
moving the block into your config is your explicit act.

:::caution[Merge, never replace]
Merge the `provider.opencodex` block into your existing config. Replacing the whole file with the
exported one destroys your other providers, agents, keybinds, and MCP entries. `ocx export --out`
refuses to overwrite an existing file for exactly this reason, so point `--out` at a scratch path
and copy the block across:

```bash
ocx export --client opencode --out ~/opencodex-opencode.json
```
:::

Unlike the launcher's runtime block, a merged block is a static snapshot: it does not follow your
catalog. Re-run `ocx export` after you add a provider or change model visibility.

Once merged, export the admission key before launching opencode — unless the proxy is on loopback,
where none is needed:

```bash
export OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY=<your key>
```

## The admission key is not written to disk

When the proxy requires an API key, the inline runtime config carries opencode's
`{env:…}` reference rather than the secret. Loopback binds use that reference as
`apiKey`; non-loopback binds send it only through `x-opencodex-api-key` so proxy
admission stays separate from any upstream `Authorization` header.

Loopback example:

```json
"options": {
  "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:10100/v1",
  "apiKey": "{env:OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY}"
}
```

Non-loopback example:

```json
"options": {
  "baseURL": "http://192.168.1.10:10100/v1",
  "headers": {
    "x-opencodex-api-key": "{env:OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

The real value is passed only through the child process environment.
`OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN` takes precedence, then the hardened service token file, then
a configured API key — which is what a non-loopback bind requires.

A loopback bind (`127.0.0.1`, the default) authenticates nothing, so the `{env:…}` reference is
inert and you can leave the variable unset. It matters only when `hostname` is set beyond loopback;
see [Remote access](/reference/configuration/#remote-access). This admission key is opencodex's
own, and is unrelated to the upstream provider keys configured under
[Providers](/guides/providers/).

## Reverting

Nothing to undo — no generated config file is written under `~/.opencodex`. Run plain
`opencode` and it reads your own config exactly as before.

## Model limits

opencode's schema requires `limit.context` and `limit.output` as a pair. OpenCodex emits the block
only when both values are authoritative, using exact provider metadata or an explicit custom-model
output value. If either value is unknown, the whole block is omitted and opencode keeps its own
defaults. The retired `32000` schema placeholder is never emitted.

The `opencodex` provider block is regenerated on every launch, so per-model tweaks made inside it
will not survive. Keep custom entries under a provider key of your own instead.

## Requirements

opencode must be installed and on `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```
